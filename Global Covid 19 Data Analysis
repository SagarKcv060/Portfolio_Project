2. Covid vaccinations

From both the datasets the following columns are used for analysis:

3. Looking at Countries with highest Infection rate compared to population
4. SHOWING CONTINENTS WITH HIGHEST DEATH COUNT
5. SHOWING COUNTRIES WITH HIGHEST DEATH COUNT

7. Global Numbers - total deaths starting from 01.01.2020 to 30.04.2021
8. Global Numbers - Total cases, Total deaths and Death Percentage
    Joining the CovidDeaths and CovidVaccination Tables based on Location and Date
9. Looking at Total Population vs Vaccinations
10. Looking at Continents with Location having new Vaccinations
11. Looking at Cumulative People Vaccinated order by Location and date
12. Creation of CTE table to get Percentage of Population Vaccinated as per Locationwise
13. Creation of TEMP table to get Percentage of Cumulative Peoplevaccinated (where continent is not null)
14. CREATING VIEWS of Percent Population vaccinated;
